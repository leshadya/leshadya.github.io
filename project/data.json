      "image": "images/ll1.jpg",
      "content": "Bilingualism is not just about speaking two languages; it's about opening doors to new cultures, perspectives, and ways of thinking. Beyond the obvious advantage of being able to communicate with a wider range of people, bilingualism has significant cognitive benefits. Research has shown that bilingual individuals often exhibit enhanced executive functions such as better problem-solving skills, improved multitasking abilities, and greater cognitive flexibility. Moreover, bilingualism has been linked to a delayed onset of dementia and other age-related cognitive decline. Embracing bilingualism not only enriches our personal lives but also enhances our cognitive resilience as we age. Furthermore, being bilingual can provide economic advantages by increasing employability in an increasingly globalized job market. Bilingual individuals are often sought after by employers for their ability to navigate diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, making them valuable assets in fields such as international business, diplomacy, and translation. From a societal perspective, bilingualism promotes inclusivity and cultural understanding by bridging language barriers and fostering empathy towards speakers of other languages. In an interconnected world, where diversity is celebrated and collaboration is paramount, bilingualism emerges as a vital skill that empowers individuals to engage with and contribute to a multicultural society."

      "image": "images/ll2.jpg",
      "content": "Imagination can be a powerful tool in the learning process. I create a story or scenario with a beginning-to-end plot to understand complex topics. I also integrate Zoltan Dörnyei's theories on language learning and teaching motivation into this method to write a reflection.Zoltan Dörnyei is an expert in language learning motivation. His theories provide important guidance for increasing students' motivation during the language learning process. In my method of learning through imagination, I also leverage Dörnyei's motivation theories. When I tackle a complex topic, I first create a story or scenario related to that topic. This story or scenario includes meaningful or meaningless connections between events. It transforms into a visual story in my mind, helping me easily recall the information I need to learn.Dörnyei's motivation theories enhance this process. While creating the story, I set goals and increase my motivation to reach these goals. For example, if there's a problem to solve or a topic to learn by the end of the story, I put in more effort to achieve that goal. This makes my learning process more effective.In conclusion, the method of learning through imagination and Zoltan Dörnyei's motivation theories combined provide me with a highly productive learning experience. This approach not only makes understanding complex topics easier but also makes the learning process more enjoyable. It has become an important learning strategy for me."

      "image": "images/ll4.webp",
      "content": "The topic of vision in language teaching allows us to better understand the role of vision in motivating students and teachers. He can use various fields such as psychology and education to emphasize the importance of envisioning future selves with sensory details and images. By aligning these visions with reality and strengthening them by separating them from external pressures, teachers can create an environment that encourages long-term participation and commitment to language learning. In this context, the transformative potential of vision in shaping classroom dynamics and increasing teaching effectiveness is emphasized.The topics covered explain the importance of personalized approaches in promoting motivation and well-being. In my opinion, researchers and educators can maximize the results of interventions and promote development in various populations by recognizing individual differences and adapting interventions to the unique needs and desires of individuals. Ongoing research in positive psychology and language teaching can improve intervention strategies and optimize their effectiveness in promoting resilience and engagement.As a result, the content of the intervention provides valuable information about individual differences and the complex interaction between psychological processes. By improving our understanding of the mechanisms underlying motivational interventions and educational practices, we should take steps to pave the way for future research and applications aimed at promoting well-being and improving learning outcomes."

As a non-native speaker, I embarked on this journey with determination and enthusiasm, eager to immerse myself in the richness of the Spanish language and culture. From the outset, I encountered obstacles such as unfamiliar grammar structures, pronunciation difficulties, and cultural nuances that seemed elusive at first. However, with perseverance, patience, and a willingness to embrace the learning process, I gradually made progress and gained confidence in my language abilities. Along the way, I discovered the beauty of Spanish literature, music, and art, which provided valuable insights into the cultural heritage and diversity of Spanish-speaking countries. Every milestone, whether it was mastering verb conjugations, engaging in meaningful conversations with native speakers, or exploring Spanish-speaking regions firsthand, filled me with a sense of accomplishment and joy. Beyond language proficiency, my journey through Spanish fluency has enriched my life in countless ways, opening doors to new friendships, opportunities, and perspectives. It has taught me the importance of resilience, curiosity, and cultural empathy in navigating unfamiliar territories and connecting with people from diverse backgrounds. As I continue my journey towards mastery of the Spanish language, I am reminded of the endless possibilities that language learning offers for personal growth, intercultural communication, and global citizenship."

      "content": "This is the beginning of a new adventure. We should admit starting new adventures or, in other words, trying new things is a part of our lives, for example starting a university, getting a job, having new responsibilities… We can count so many things like these. For each one of the beginnings, it’s normal to feel unsafe as this is human nature. But should we panic? Or worse, should we refuse to do new things? Is it possible to live in a routine from the beginning until the end of our lives? Life is a journey which has different ways with different feelings, right? Probably if we try to think about the things which we haven’t tried yet, we can find so many different things. All of us have just started university and university life is a thing which we haven’t seen yet. Remember your first day at university, they’re so different from the ones at high school, eh? Maybe you have just begun to live in another city far from your hometown, far from your family, your high school friends etc. Maybe even far from the past… If I should talk about my first day at campus, I was very nervous because almost everything I saw was new to me; new people, new teachers, new buildings… All of those were so different from the past and I was afraid to continue. To be honest I remember I think to quit. Sounds like a coward but was that because I was a coward? If you’re thinking something like that now, is it because you’re a chicken? Or is there something different that we couldn’t see? Let’s think about the cause of our negative feelings, is it because we can’t do anything? Or is it about trying “new things”? I mean facing new issues which we haven’t faced before. Let’s call them “unexpected issues” as you have no idea about them. For me, it is normal to panic when we face an unexpected issue, but this should not affect our decisions. But is it the same for you? What do you think? Let me give an example to observe from life to you. Then you can think and if you want, tell me about your ideas too. Think about the babies. You know, babies first crawl, then start to walk, and finally begin to run and set the woods on fire, right? Whenever babies fall or damage themselves, they cry. But most of the time they don’t have visible damage. So, why do they cry? If there isn’t any noticeable damage, why do they react that much? Do they cry because of their pain, or do they cry because they face this unexpected issue? That’s another question. For me, they react by crying when they face an unexpected feeling. But sooner or later babies walk, then run, and then set the wood on fire. If you agree with me, I’ve got an idea about our negative feelings about unexpected issues. Here it is. As we did when we were babies, we still give reactions when we face an unexpected issue. It is like an instinct you know. We don’t cry every time, but we give reactions like sadness, anger and some other stuff you can imagine. Each of us is different, that’s a fact. Because of that, we can give different reactions to different feelings. So, if we don’t feel the same as others with the same issues, we don’t have to blame ourselves too. To sum up dear reader, maybe we’re still a baby about some cases because we do not have enough experience with those cases. But when we feel frustrated, we do not have to blame ourselves or give up. We have the same instinct, and this instinct is a need to be human. When you feel a way like this, remind yourself it has not any danger to give it a try. Remember, we all first give crawling a try, then walking, then running. And who knows, even if you fall many times, why don’t you set the wood on fire at the end? Ömer Faruk Acar"

Especially when I'm trying to solve errors encountered while coding, my efforts to understand the problem can sometimes result in a solution popping into my mind unexpectedly. After struggling for hours to understand an error message, a sudden idea comes and I make a simple correction to solve the problem. This moment is an Aha moment.Similarly, Aha moments can occur when I'm learning a new programming language or library. A concept that seems difficult to grasp at first suddenly becomes logical, and I can now work more comfortably on that topic.Moreover, Aha moments can also occur when I need to use my creativity while coding. For example, a complex requirement encountered in a project, a momentary distraction, or a solution seen in another project can make me consider a new approach in my project, creating an Aha moment.Therefore, as a programmer, I should constantly learn new things and experience different things. Because these experiences can open the doors to new Aha moments for me and improve my problem-solving skills."

Actually, I would do the following:Firstly, it seems to me that the more the session is interactive the more it becomes interesting and would bring the session alive, So in order to do so I would play a mini game that called  ''Do you own your best self?'' here I used own instead of know in order to arouse curiosity among learners and grab the attention and try to find out whether this is our true best self or not.Secondly, I would do mini-imagination Tournament among the learners by making all of the players close their eyes and try to imagine the picture that I describe after that I would note the imagination of the players and the winner player will be the one who imagine the closest scene to the picture.So, to sum up, I believe that by adding some interactive mini activities in the session would definitely be beneficial to train the learners with concentration close to perfection"

At the beginning of the year, I was a boy sitting quietly in the corner of the prep class. I felt lucky when I met the cheerful red-haired woman who was my teacher because she was not interested in what was going on in the classroom like other teachers. She was interested in the world outside the classroom and said that's what matters. One day she asked us if we would like to come to the PA program to share something with each other in the outside world. Actually, on my first day in the PA program, I didn't know what was going to happen in the future, but over time, we started to get our education by supporting each other with our friends. It was the hope of helping each other and other people that kept us at the club throughout this process. We were learning more and having more fun at the club with each passing day. We met many people and got on very well outside of the club, and we did all this just by listening to each other. Now we are graduating and we will get our certificates. These certificates mean more to us than a piece of paper because they are our wings to reach other colourful butterflies. May the love be with you."

It involves recognizing and embracing all aspects of oneself, including strengths, weaknesses, and imperfections, without judgment or self-criticism. Today, I attended a self-acceptance session at the LAP Club. Firstly, the facilitator introduced us to the butterfly model and asked us whether we accept ourselves or not. Then, she incorporated quotes from the Dalai Lama and the broken bowl metaphor from Japanese culture to engage us in the topic. Afterward, she explained what self-acceptance is and what it encompasses, which I found highly successful in helping us integrate with the topic. I plan to use this approach in my own presentations. She also talked about the difference between evaluating ourselves and evaluating our behavior, which was excellent for creating awareness. This was where I had my first aha moment. Then, she explained how we can accept ourselves and distributed a tool consisting of three parts on paper, which I found effective. I believe that effective speaking followed by awareness and the reflection of that awareness on paper is beneficial. From my perspective, this LAP session was productive. I learned that being interactive during presentations can help engage people in the discussion and the topic itself."

      "content": "The presentation of the guidance tool called Vision Board in the LAP club speaking class was truly impressive. This presentation was supported by a speech and visual elements while explaining what the tool is and how it can be used. In particular, Cemre's sharing of her own Vision Board made the subject concrete and increased the depth of the subject with examples. Another element that increased the depth of the presentation was the quotes of some scientists. These quotes made the subject more understandable by emphasizing the power of the Vision Board and the importance of its use. Additionally, presenters engaged the audience by asking powerful questions (like; Are you satisfied your life? What is your wishes?) and clearly explaining how the tool should be used. One of the most impressive aspects of the presentation was that it answered questions such as why the Vision Board should be used, how it should be used, the benefits it will provide and how it can be prepared. In this way, at the end of the presentation, the audience had no questions left in their minds and had the knowledge to use the Vision Board effectively.If I had moderated the session, I think I would have kept the basic layout of the presentation the same because the flow and development of the presentation was quite impressive. However, as a different approach, I would have preferred to interact more with my presenter to create a more conversational atmosphere during the presentation. This can help explain the topic in a more intimate setting and draw participants in more. I don't know how effective it will be, but I can say that it is an approach that has always attracted me more.  I would like to thank my friends who made the presentation. We had a really nice session with my friends."
